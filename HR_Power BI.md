## Exploring Employee Demographics and Turnover Rates: An analysis using Power BI

### Project Description
In this case study, I have been hired to analyze employee information from the human resources department in order to better understand employee dynamics and behavior. By leveraging the data provided in the simulated dataset, I was be able to identify trends and patterns that can help improve workplace productivity. This includes examining employee demographics, such as age and gender, as well as factors such as employee performance and reasons for leaving the company. 





### Data Set
Data came from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set). **Power Query** was used in the ETL cleaning process and **Power BI** was used in the data visualization process. Here is the full link to Power BI Dashboard:

### Data Structure
There is only one dataset:

```Columns: Employee_Name,	EmpID,	MarriedID,	MaritalStatusID,	GenderID,	EmpStatusID,	DeptID,	PerfScoreID,	FromDiversityJobFairID,	Salary,	Termd,	PositionID,	Position,	State,	Zip, DOB,	Sex,	MaritalDesc,	CitizenDesc,	HispanicLatino,	RaceDesc,	DateofHire,	DateofTermination,	TermReason,	EmploymentStatus,	Department,	ManagerName,	ManagerID,	RecruitmentSource,	PerformanceScore,	EngagementSurvey,	EmpSatisfaction,	SpecialProjectsCount,	LastPerformanceReview_Date,	DaysLateLast30,	Absences```
