## Exploring Employee Demographics and Turnover Rates: An analysis using Power BI

### Project Description
In this case study, I have been hired to analyze employee information from the human resources department in order to better understand employee dynamics and behavior. By leveraging the data provided in the simulated dataset, I was be able to identify trends and patterns that can help improve workplace productivity. This includes examining employee demographics, such as age and gender, as well as factors such as employee performance and reasons for leaving the company. 





### Data Set
Data came from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set). **Power Query** was used in the ETL cleaning process and **Power BI** was used in the data visualization process. Here is the full link to Power BI Dashboard:

### Data Structure
There is only one dataset:
HRDataset_v14 <br>
```Columns: Employee_Name,	EmpID,	MarriedID,	MaritalStatusID,	GenderID,	EmpStatusID,	DeptID,	PerfScoreID,	FromDiversityJobFairID,	Salary,	Termd,	PositionID,	Position,	State,	Zip, DOB,	Sex,	MaritalDesc,	CitizenDesc,	HispanicLatino,	RaceDesc,	DateofHire,	DateofTermination,	TermReason,	EmploymentStatus,	Department,	ManagerName,	ManagerID,	RecruitmentSource,	PerformanceScore,	EngagementSurvey,	EmpSatisfaction,	SpecialProjectsCount,	LastPerformanceReview_Date,	DaysLateLast30,	Absences```


### Key Questions

- What is the average salary of employees in each department?
- How many employees have been terminated and what were the reasons for their termination?
- Is there a correlation between employee engagement survey scores and their performance score?
- What is the distribution of employees based on their gender, race, and citizenship status?
- Which recruitment sources have resulted in the most successful hires?
- What is the average number of absences per employee in each department?
- How many employees were hired through diversity job fairs and what is their performance compared to other employees?
- Is there a relationship between an employee's position and their salary?
- What is the turnover rate of employees in each department?
- Are there any trends in the performance review scores of employees over time?

The majority of people that work at this company are White (59.9%) with Black or African American (24.64%) following second.

The performance of the current employees (Active) is majority 'Fully Meets' with 162 out of the 207 current employees. This is great! That is 78% of staff currently working at this company. It is interesting to see that the second highest group of individuals that have a 'Fully Meets' performance is the ones that voluntarily terminated their positions within the company. This is a great indicator to look deeper into why these people left their positions. This is a good segway to look into the termination reasons.
