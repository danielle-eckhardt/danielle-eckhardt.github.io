## Human Resources Presence Insights: An analysis using Power BI

### Project Description
In this case study, I hired to analyze employee information (a simulated dataset) from the human resources department. 
The focus is to understand employee dynamics and behavior to improve workplace productivity.


### Data Set
Data came from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set). **Power Query** was used in the ETL cleaning process and **Power BI** was used in the data visualization process. Here is the full link to Power BI Dashboard:

### Data Structure
There is only one dataset:
HRDataset_v14 <br>
```Columns: Employee_Name,	EmpID,	MarriedID,	MaritalStatusID,	GenderID,	EmpStatusID,	DeptID,	PerfScoreID,	FromDiversityJobFairID,	Salary,	Termd,	PositionID,	Position,	State,	Zip, DOB,	Sex,	MaritalDesc,	CitizenDesc,	HispanicLatino,	RaceDesc,	DateofHire,	DateofTermination,	TermReason,	EmploymentStatus,	Department,	ManagerName,	ManagerID,	RecruitmentSource,	PerformanceScore,	EngagementSurvey,	EmpSatisfaction,	SpecialProjectsCount,	LastPerformanceReview_Date,	DaysLateLast30,	Absences```


### Key Questions
