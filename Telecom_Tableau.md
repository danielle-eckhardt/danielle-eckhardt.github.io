## Unlocking Insights into Customer Behavior and Service Utilization for a Telecommunications Company in California ##

### Project Description
In this project, I have been hired to analyze customer data for a fictional telecommunications company that provides phone and internet services. 
The objective of the analysis is to gain insights into customer behavior and identify strategies for increasing customer retention and driving revenue growth. 
By leveraging statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms to explore customer demographics, service usage, and churn behavior, we aim to identify the key factors that influence customer churn and develop data-driven solutions for reducing churn rates and improving customer satisfaction. 
Ultimately, the results of this analysis will enable the company to optimize their business strategies and achieve sustained revenue growth in a competitive market.

### Data Set
This dataset contains information on customer churn of 7,043 individuals located in California. 
It includes demographic information, geographic location, details about services, and current status. 
This dataset came from [Maven Analytics](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?dataStructure=2lXwWbWANQgI727tVx3DRC) and **Tableau** was used for analysis and visualizations. 

### Data Structure

6. What are the most common reasons for customer churn, and which factors have the strongest influence on churn behavior?
7. Are there any patterns or trends in the service usage behavior of customers who are more likely to churn, and how can these insights be used to inform targeted retention strategies?
8. What is the lifetime value of a customer for the telecommunications company, and how does this vary across different customer segments?
9. Can we predict which customers are most likely to churn, and if so, what factors are the strongest predictors of churn behavior?
