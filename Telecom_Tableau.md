## Unlocking Insights into Customer Behavior and Service Utilization for a Telecommunications Company in California ##

### Project Description
In this project, I have been hired to analyze customer data for a fictional telecommunications company that provides phone and internet services. 
The objective of the analysis is to gain insights into customer behavior and identify strategies for increasing customer retention and driving revenue growth. 
By leveraging statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms to explore customer demographics, service usage, and churn behavior, we aim to identify the key factors that influence customer churn and develop data-driven solutions for reducing churn rates and improving customer satisfaction. 
Ultimately, the results of this analysis will enable the company to optimize their business strategies and achieve sustained revenue growth in a competitive market.

### Data Set
This dataset contains information on customer churn of 7,043 individuals located in California. 
It includes demographic information, geographic location, details about services, and current status. 
This dataset came from [Maven Analytics](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?dataStructure=2lXwWbWANQgI727tVx3DRC) and **Tableau** was used for analysis and visualizations. 

### Data Structure
There are two datasets, telecom_customer_churn and telecom_zipcode_population. The zip code dataset allows us to create a geographical map comparing population sizes with other factors such as revenue.
```Columns: Field	CustomerID	Gender	Age	Married	Number of Dependents	City	Zip Code	Latitude	Longitude	Number of Referrals	Tenure in Months	Offer	Phone Service	Avg Monthly Long Distance Charges	Multiple Lines	Internet Service	Internet Type	Avg Monthly GB Download	Online Security	Online Backup	Device Protection Plan	Premium Tech Support	Streaming TV	Streaming Movies	Streaming Music	Unlimited Data	Contract	Paperless Billing	Payment Method	Monthly Charge	Total Charges	Total Refunds	Total Extra Data Charges	Total Long Distance Charges	Total Revenue	Customer Status	Churn Category	Churn Reason	Zip Code	Population```


### Key Questions
1. How many customers joined the company? 
2. What is the customer profile for a customer that churned, joined, and stayed? Are they different?
3. What seem to be the key drivers of customer churn?
4. Is the company losing high value customers? If so, how can they retain them?
5. What is the overall churn rate for the telecommunications company, and how does it vary across different customer segments (e.g. age, location, service usage)?
6. What are the most common reasons for customer churn, and which factors have the strongest influence on churn behavior?
7. Are there any patterns or trends in the service usage behavior of customers who are more likely to churn, and how can these insights be used to inform targeted retention strategies?
8. What is the lifetime value of a customer for the telecommunications company, and how does this vary across different customer segments?
10. What are the key drivers of customer satisfaction, and how can the telecommunications company optimize their business strategies to improve overall satisfaction and reduce churn rates?
