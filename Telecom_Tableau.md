## Unlocking Insights into Customer Behavior and Service Utilization for a Telecommunications Company in California ##

### Project Description
In this project, I have been hired to analyze customer data for a fictional telecommunications company that provides phone and internet services. 
The objective of the analysis is to gain insights into customer behavior and identify strategies for increasing customer retention and driving revenue growth. 
By leveraging statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms to explore customer demographics, service usage, and churn behavior, we aim to identify the key factors that influence customer churn and develop data-driven solutions for reducing churn rates and improving customer satisfaction. 
Ultimately, the results of this analysis will enable the company to optimize their business strategies and achieve sustained revenue growth in a competitive market.

### Data Set
This dataset contains information on customer churn of 7,043 individuals located in California. 
It includes demographic information, geographic location, details about services, and current status. 
This dataset came from [Maven Analytics](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?dataStructure=2lXwWbWANQgI727tVx3DRC) and **Tableau** was used for analysis and visualizations.

5. What is the overall churn rate for the telecommunications company, and how does it vary across different customer segments (e.g. age, location, service usage)?
6. What are the most common reasons for customer churn, and which factors have the strongest influence on churn behavior?
7. Are there any patterns or trends in the service usage behavior of customers who are more likely to churn, and how can these insights be used to inform targeted retention strategies?
