## Nitrogen and Phosphorus Budgets in Estuaries Along the Texas Coast
The focus of this project was to conduct a meta-analysis on water quality over an extended period of time using **SAS 9.4**. This project is currently undergoing preparations to be published as a chapter in the new environmental report on freshwater inflow to Texas estuaries. 


### Summary


### Data Sources

1. Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) <br>
```Contains all the water data including gaged flows, ungaged flows, modeled flows, diversions, and evaporation rates from 1940-2020```
2. National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) database
```Contains all the precipitation data at weather stations nearest to each estuary from 1940-2020```
3. Texas Parks & Wildlife Department (TPWD) <br>
```Contains all the salinity data in each bay system and their adjacent gulf stations offshore from 1977-2020```
4. Texas Commission of Environmental Quality (TCEQ) <br>
```Contains all of the nutrient data in each bay system and their adjacent gulf stations offshore from 1969-2020```

### Key Findings

Please note, there was a lot of SAS programs that went into the ETL process that is not included on here before analyses.
