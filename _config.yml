  I found my love for data analytics when I was conducting research for my master's thesis at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi.
  I have a strong background in statistics and multivariate analysis and always had a go-getter attitude. I taught myself SQL, Power Query, PowerBI, and Tableau
  and have been using R and SAS extensively throughout my post graduate degree.
