## Clothing Store Database & Stats: An analysis using SQL

**Project description:** In this case study, I am hired as a marketing analyst to interpret the research about a companyâ€™s consumers and their buying habits.

### Data Set
This data set was analyzed in SQLiteStudio 3.4.3 and came from the [BreakIntoTech Data Analytics Course](https://howtobreakintotech.com/data-analytics-certificate-program/). 

[Database File](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cvsasmtr8syq2c2/BIT_DB?dl=0)

### Analysis

- How many orders were placed in January?

```SQL
SELECT count(*)
FROM bit_db.jansales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'; 
```
Here, you can see in my code there was a bit of data cleaning that needed to be included to avoid mis-calculated results. There are several entries were the 'orderID' is not a proper 6 digit code and they needed to be filtered out in the calculation.

There are 9681 orders placed in January.

- 

```SQL
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```
