## Project Name

### Project Description
I am hired by a healthcare company to assess the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in seven U.S. states in 2018. Learning about austism and the diagnosis trends can give people a greater understanding for the condition so that in the future we can possibly treat it or manage it more effectively. 

### Dataset
This data set came from the [CDC](https://data.cdc.gov/dataset/county-level-ASD-prevalence-estimates/7vg3-e5u2). It was analyzed and visualized in **Tableau**.

### Data Structure
There is one dataset: county-level_ASD_prevalence_estimates <br> 
Columns: 
```fips_county, county_name, cases_asd, pop, prevalence_asd, prevalence_asd_ci, map_category```


### Key Questions
1. What is the overall prevalence of ASD in the population aged 3-21 years?
2. Which county has the highest prevalence of ASD, and which has the lowest?
3. Is there a relationship between county population size and ASD prevalence?
4. Are there any geographic patterns in ASD prevalence across the US?
5. Is there a significant difference in ASD prevalence between different map categories?
6. How do the Wilson score confidence intervals for ASD prevalence compare across counties?
7. Are there any outliers in the data set that could be affecting the overall prevalence estimate?
